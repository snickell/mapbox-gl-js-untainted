**MapsGL** is a community fork derived from [mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js), which as of Dec 8, 2020 is no longer open source.

[<img width="200" alt="MapsGL" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/223277/101580282-7534f700-397e-11eb-8b58-687f52e2a8cf.png">](http://mapsgl.org)

To **contribute in the early stages, [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/maps-gl/maps-gl)**, file issues, or email hackerswelcome@mapsgl.org. 

Anyone with a stake in a healthy community fork is welcome to help us figure out our next steps. In the short term, we'll be very open to granting project leadership/commit privileges. When in doubt, we favour including everyone (with some github/gitlab/other reputation we can verify) affected by the license change, with the **goal of minimizing fragmentation**.

If you are a company or project depending on an open source `mapbox-gl-js`, please consider joining our effort instead of starting your own fork :-) We would *much* rather have it "one project" rather than "our way" ;-)
